# Machine Learning Class Repository

This repository contains my **Machine Learning lab work and practice implementations** developed during coursework.  
The objective of this repository is to understand Machine Learning concepts by **implementing algorithms from scratch**, visualizing results, and comparing model performances.

The repository includes implementations of both **regression and classification algorithms**, along with Jupyter notebooks for graphical analysis and result interpretation.

Algorithms are implemented using Python with a strong focus on:
- Mathematical understanding
- Step-by-step model building
- Performance comparison
- Visualization of outputs

This repository will be **continuously updated** as more Machine Learning concepts, algorithms, and experiments are added.
